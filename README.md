# Diamond Menu

Why use diamond menus?
  - to separate subjects from capabilities
  - to get rid of all the buttons that clutter UIs
  - and take advantage of all the buttons on keyboards
  - to eliminate keyboard shortcuts
  - and mouse based menu navigation
  - and take advantage of positional semantics
  - to transcend the current state of the art
